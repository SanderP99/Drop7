          dropped the given disk explode effectively, and all non-visible

        - Subsequently, disks that are to explode in the new state of the
          board explode effectively, with all non-visible disks
          adjacent to the exploding disks being cracked. This process

          for a single exploding disk in the given step.
        - If the given disk and/or the given column is None, no disk is
